\section{Introduction}

When I started hacking with the YS protocol, I knew nothing about sockets, internet protocols, and serialization, but I had great ambitions. The quest was huge for the ignorant knight I was. After years of patience, reading, experimenting, asking questions, sharing code, ... I ended up to get a "little" idea of the YS protocol. But even with this knowledge, the quest will be huge for you.


\section{The YS protocol and its links with TCP}

In the OSI model, the YS protocol belongs to the application layer, just above TCP. The choice made by Soji Yamakawa of choosing TCP in the transport layer has the following connections :
\begin{itemize}
    \item more data is sent since the TCP header is quite big compared to other protocols of the transport layer
    \item if a packet was lost, TCP waits for the server server to send it again although the following packets were successfully received which leads to phenomenons were you see your opponent flying backward during a network play.
    \item necessity of separating the YS messages since contrary to the UDP protocol, TCP concatenate all the messages to send in its buffer and send them when the buffer is full enough or old enough. That is why all the YS messages start with an integer giving the size of the message. This issue can be avoided by the use of the TCP PUSH flag.
    \item the OS implementation of the TCP keep-alive is not mandatory, that is why it is done in the application layer.
    \item you are certain all you messages were received, however the YS protocol force the client to send a copy of the received message to check it received the same thing, which I think is useless. The flaw is that if you don't reply to those messages, the server keep sending it you!
\end{itemize}

\section{Prerequisites}

\subsection{Sockets}
Available in almost all programming language and operating system.

\subsection{Serialisation - data representation}

\subsubsection{Norms}

By serialization  I mean the process of converting human readable data to its computer format.

All data is sent in \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness}{little endian}, which is the format used by the most common PC processors. 

Shorts are coded on 2 octets. Eg 258=0x12 will become $02:01$ (little endian)

Integers are coded on 4 octets.

Signed numbers are coded using the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two\%27s\_complement}{two complement}.

Floats are coded using the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE\_754-1985}{IEEE 754 1985 norm}

String are coded in ASCII, the null character is put at the end of the string to determine/delineate/demarcate it.

\subsubsection{Exemples}

\paragraph{C}

\begin{minted}[mathescape]{c}
#include <string.h>

struct info {
	short        var1;
	unsigned int var2;
	float        var3;
	long         var4;
	char         var5[6];
};

// We encode the data
struct info info2send;
info2send.var1 = 42;
info2send.var2 = 55555;
info2send.var3 = 3.14;
info2send.var4 = 7777777;
strcpy(info2send.var5, "hello");
memcpy(buffer, (char *)&myInfo, 24);

// We decode the data
struct info info2recv
memcpy((char *)&info2recv, buffer, 24);

\end{minted}

\paragraph{Perl}

\begin{minted}[mathescape]{python}
$buffer = pack("hIfla5",42,55555,3.14,7777777,"hello");
$data = unpack("hIfla5", buffer);
\end{minted}

\paragraph{PHP}

\begin{minted}[mathescape]{python}
// Returns a string
$buffer = pack("hIfla5",42,55555,3.14,7777777,"hello");

// Returns an array
$data = unpack("hIfla5", buffer);
\end{minted}

\paragraph{Python}

\begin{minted}{python}	
import struct

# pack will return you the string of the serialized information
buffer = struct.pack("hIfl6s",42,55555,3.14,7777777,"hello")

# unpack will return you the tuple of the unserialized information
data = struct.unpack("hIfl6s", buffer)
\end{minted}

\section{The specifications of the YS protocol}

\subsection{The header}

The YS messages have the following shape: \\

\begin{tabularx}{8cm}{|X|X|X|}
\hline
Length (int) & Type (int) & Data \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}

\vspace{0.5cm}
Every YS message start with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a length information = data size + type size = data size + 4
    \item the type of the packet (the purpose of its content)
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.3cm}
For example let's decode the following message:
\begin{verbatim}
18:00:00:00:01:00:00:00:64:6f:69:6e:67:5f:74:65:73:74:73:00:00:00:00:00:7f:db:32:01
\end{verbatim}

$18:00:00:00$ = (int 24) is the size of the message

$01:00:00:00$ = (int 1) is the type of the message, 1 means it's a login message

$64:6f:69:6e:67:5f:74:65:73:74:73:00:00:00:00:00:7f:db:32:01$ is the data

\vspace{0.3cm}
Here is a Python piece of code to cope with the previous example.

\begin{minted}{python}	
import struct, socket, sys

s = socket.socket()
s.connect(('127.0.0.1', 7915))

# ...
try:
    size = unpack("I",s.recv(4))[0]
    type = unpack("I",s.recv(4))[0]
    data = s.recv(size-4)
except:
    print "Reception failure."
    sys.exit(-1)
    
if type == 1:
	(username, ysVersion) = struct.unpack("16sI", data)
	# ...
elif type == 2:
	# ...
\end{minted}

\subsection{The different types}


\subsubsection{Login (type=1, 0x1)}

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{>{\raggedleft\scshape\small}p{2.5cm}X}
 char[16] & the user name (the 16$^e$ bit is the null character)\\
\gray int & the YSFlight version of the client\\
\end{tabularx}

\vspace{0.3cm}
In the example above we had:\\
$64:6f:69:6e:67:5f:74:65:73:74:73:00:00:00:00:00$ = (doing\_tests) the username
$7f:db:32:01$ = (20010207) the YSFlight version

\vspace{0.4cm}
\subsubsection{Map (type=4, 0x4)}

 int & kind of killer entity (0=the killer is ground object, 1=the killer is a player)\\
\gray short & power of the damage\\
 & If you want to kill an object of strength 3 in one shot, this value must be 3.\\
